This is a full-stack Solidity app (using Ethers.js) which an organization can use to 
mint new ERC20 tokens and set up a vesting schedule for them. Newly minted tokens can  
be allocated to Founders, Investors, and Presale Buyers in a smart contract in ratios 
determined by the organization. 

After allocation, the tokens can then be locked up for any desired time period. The tokens 
can only be withdrawn from the smart contract after the vesting period has ended. 

There is also a Presale page, where buyers can deposit ETH into a smart contract to
purchase a percentage of the new tokens (which are locked). The organization can determine 
the exchange rate in advance (i.e., how many tokens can be purchased with 1 ETH).
